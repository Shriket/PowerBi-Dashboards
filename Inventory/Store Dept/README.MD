---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧗‍♂️ **Key Obstacles Faced** 

-**Negative Values in Data:** The dataset contained negative values in fields where they are not logically possible (e.g., sales quantities, inventory levels). This skewed calculations and reporting.
    *   *Mitigation:* Investigated and Resolved it through cross-functional team meetings (DGM, department staff, ERP consultant).

*   **Duplicate Item Names and Categories:** Duplicate entries for item names and categories were present, leading to ambiguity and inaccurate aggregation of data.
    *   *Mitigation:* Identification and merger of duplicate entries. Standardized item naming and categorization conventions have been performed.

*   **Unwanted Item Grouping:** Items were grouped in ways that did not reflect business logic or were inconsistent with established categories. This made it difficult to analyze data trends and identify top-stock level products.
    *   *Mitigation:* Revised the item grouping logic based on business requirements and created new, more appropriate categories. Updated the dashboard to reflect the corrected item groupings.
