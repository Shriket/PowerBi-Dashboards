## üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Key Obstacles Faced** 
## Data Discrepancies

*   **Zero Kmpl Average and Time Average Columns:** The dashboard displayed zero values in the "Kmpl average" (kilometers per liter) and "Time average" columns, indicating potential data entry errors or system malfunctions.
    *   *Mitigation:* Investigated the root cause of existing zero values and corrected them with the approval of directors.

*   **Unknown Labeled Blank Entries:** The presence of "Unknown" labels for blank entries created ambiguity and hindered accurate analysis of the underlying data.
    *   *Mitigation:* Investigated the root cause of existing "Unknown" labels, and clarified data entry guidelines to avoid blank entries to data entry operators conducting meetings in presence of their Hod.

*   **Zero Std Avg Column:** Zero values in the "Std avg" (standard average) column suggested potential data quality issues or errors in calculation.
    *   *Mitigation:* Reviewed the calculation logic for the "Std avg" column and corrected the errors, by implementing data quality checks to ensure accurate data input.

*   **No Proper Machine Working Reason:** Lack of detailed "machine working reason" entries hampered the understanding of machine performance ,maintenance needs, and lead to inaccurate machine efficiency analysis.
    *   *Mitigation:* Provided clear guidelines and training to data entry operators with erp consultant on properly documenting machine working reasons. Implemented mandatory fields for reason entries.

*   **Backdated Entries:** The presence of entries with backdated timestamps affected the integrity of historical data and could lead to inaccurate trend analysis.
    *   *Mitigation:* Investigated the root cause of existing "Backdated Entries" and Provided clear guidelines to data entry operators on not keeping pendency in data entries

## üéØ **Key Features & Insights**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fleet Operational Status**  
- **Monitor machinery distribution** based on **working, idle, and breakdown status**.  
- **Identify breakdown reasons** for quick action and reduced downtime.  
- **Track driver-machine assignments** for accountability.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Efficiency & Utilization Tracking**  
- **Monitor average running hours** per machine and compare with expected usage.  
- **Identify low-performing machinery** that fails to meet operational benchmarks.  
- **Analyze total trips per vehicle** and detect inconsistencies.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fuel Consumption & Cost Management**  
- **Track total fuel consumption** by site and vehicle category.  
- **Monitor vehicle fuel efficiency (kmpl) per category** to reduce wastage.  
- **Plan monthly and daily fuel budgets** based on real usage trends.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Resource Allocation & Urgent Needs**  
- **Locate available JCBs and critical machinery** at nearby sites for urgent requirements.  
- **Decide whether to transfer equipment or rent externally** based on availability.  
- **Identify sites requiring urgent attention due to critical breakdowns.**  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Breakdown Analysis & Maintenance Planning**  
- **Identify longest-standing breakdowns** to prioritize repairs.  
- **Track the oldest and newest breakdowns** across all sites.  
- **Analyze machine downtime trends** to improve preventive maintenance strategies.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Consistency & Fraud Detection**  
- **Verify trip reports for discrepancies** (e.g., only 3 trips expected, but system logs 7).  
- **Detect fuel fraud** by comparing consumption patterns with operational hours.  
- **Identify underperforming sites or machineries** based on fuel efficiency and machine productivity.
