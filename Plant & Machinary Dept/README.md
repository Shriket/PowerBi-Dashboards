# **Plant & Machinery Dashboard**

## 🚀 Overview  
The **Plant & Machinery Dashboard** provides a **real-time operational overview** of **250+ Equipments** across all the projects. Designed to **enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize resource allocation**, it offers deep insights into machinery utilization, fuel consumption, and fleet performance.

## 🎯 **Key Features & Insights**  

### 1️⃣ **Fleet Operational Status**  
- **Monitor machinery distribution** based on **working, idle, and breakdown status**.  
- **Identify breakdown reasons** for quick action and reduced downtime.  
- **Track driver-machine assignments** for accountability.  

### 2️⃣ **Efficiency & Utilization Tracking**  
- **Monitor average running hours** per machine and compare with expected usage.  
- **Identify low-performing machinery** that fails to meet operational benchmarks.  
- **Analyze total trips per vehicle** and detect inconsistencies.  

### 3️⃣ **Fuel Consumption & Cost Management**  
- **Track total fuel consumption** by site and vehicle category.  
- **Monitor vehicle fuel efficiency (kmpl) per category** to reduce wastage.  
- **Plan monthly and daily fuel budgets** based on real usage trends.  

### 4️⃣ **Resource Allocation & Urgent Needs**  
- **Locate available JCBs and critical machinery** at nearby sites for urgent requirements.  
- **Decide whether to transfer equipment or rent externally** based on availability.  
- **Identify sites requiring urgent attention due to critical breakdowns.**  

### 5️⃣ **Breakdown Analysis & Maintenance Planning**  
- **Identify longest-standing breakdowns** to prioritize repairs.  
- **Track the oldest and newest breakdowns** across all sites.  
- **Analyze machine downtime trends** to improve preventive maintenance strategies.  

### 6️⃣ **Data Consistency & Fraud Detection**  
- **Verify trip reports for discrepancies** (e.g., only 3 trips expected, but system logs 7).  
- **Detect fuel fraud** by comparing consumption patterns with operational hours.  
- **Identify underperforming sites or machineries** based on fuel efficiency and machine productivity.
