## 🧗‍♂️ **Key Obstacles Faced** 
- **Inconsistent Entries:** DPRs not logged daily.
    *   *Mitigation:* Resolved through cross-functional team meetings (HODs, department staff, ERP consultant, data entry operators).
- **Incomplete Data:** Data entry often missing.
    *   *Mitigation:* Addressed via cross-functional meetings. Added required field validation and user training.
- **Lack of Detail:** Entries lacked comprehensive information. 
    *   *Mitigation:* Resolved through team meetings. Revised DPR form with specific fields and clear guidelines.Implemented hod's daily approval for saving dpr into erp.


## 🗣️📝 Reporting & Communication 
- Findings were simultaneously reported to key stakeholders throughout the resolution process.
